# Stellar-Wallet-Dashboard

A user-friendly, web-based dashboard that provides an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) for seamless Stellar account management. Designed for non-technical users and developers alike, this application enables wallet generation, real-time balance tracking, and secure payment processing without writing a single line of code.

Beyond its utility as a wallet, this project serves as a clean reference implementation, demonstrating architecture patterns and security best practices for building modern applications on the Stellar network.
